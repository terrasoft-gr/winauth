###New Features

####Steam Guard

WinAuth can be registered as a new mobile device to create a Steam authenticator and displays the appropriate 5 character codes.

You MUST attach an SMS-capable phone number to your account before your activate your Steam authenticator, since the confirmation code are no longer sent by email, only over SMS.

Please read about the [Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator](https://winauth.com/2015/06/11/steam-guard-mobile/) for more information.

####YubiKey

WinAuth can now be used with a YubiKey to further protect the data. This will help ensure the authenticatorsâ€™ secret keys cannot be read by anyone even when they have physical access to your computer.

<img src="https://winauth.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/yubi1.png" alt="Using YubiKey with WinAuth" />

Clicking the options (cog) icon, and choosing "Change Protection...", has a new option to "Lock with a YubiKey". Ticking this will check your system for a compatible YubiKey and walk you through setting it up. You can either use an existing slot's configuration or have WinAuth generate a random secret to store on the YubiKey.

You must keep your YubiKey plugged in while using WinAuth. There will be no way to recover your authenticator data if your YubiKey is lost or damaged without programming another YubiKey with the same secret, or restoring from backups.

*YubiKey Standard / NEO 2.2.x or later is required.*

##COMMON QUESTIONS

####Is it secure? Is it safe?

All authenticators just provide another layer of security. None are 100% effective.

A physical/keychain device is by far the best protection. Although still subject to any man-in-the-middle attack, there is no way to get at the secret key stored within it. If you are at all concerned, get one of these.

An iPhone app or app on a non-rooted Android device is also secure. There is no way to get at the secret key stored on the device, however, some apps provides way to export the key that could compromise your authenticator if you do not physically protect your phone. Also if those apps backup their data elsewhere, that data could be vulnerable.

A rooted-Android phone can have your secret key read off it by an app with access. Some apps also do not encrypt the keys and so this should be considered risky.

WinAuth stores you secret key in an encrypted file on your computer. Whilst it cannot therefore provide the same security as a separate physical device, as much as possible has been done to protect the key on your machine. As above, physical access to your machine would be the only way to compromise any authenticator.

####I'm concerned this might be a virus / malware / keylogger

WinAuth has been around and used since mid-2010 and has been downloaded by thousands of users.

It has always been open-source allowing everyone to inspect and review the code. A binary is provided, but the source code is always released simultaneously so that you can review the code and build it yourself.

No personal information is sent out to any other 3rd party servers. It never even sees your account information, only your authenticator details.

There are no other executables installed on your machine. There is no installer doing things you are unable to monitor. WinAuth is portable so you can just run it from anywhere.

####I found WinAuth on another website, is it the same thing?

WinAuth source code is uploaded to GitHub at http://github.com/winauth/winauth and pre-built binaries and installers are on [winauth.com](https://winauth.com). It had been hosted using Google Code at https://code.google.com/p/winauth, but has been moved to GiHub since Google Code is being closed down. It is not published anywhere else, so please do not download any other programs claiming to be WinAuth.

####Where does WinAuth save my authenticator information?

Unlike some other authenticator applications, WinAuth does not store/send your information to any 3rd party servers. Your authenticator information is saved by default in your account roaming profile, i.e. c:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\WinAuth. However, this file can be moved anywhere and passed into WinAuth when run.
