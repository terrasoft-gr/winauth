You should also write down your SECRET keys. Cancel this dialog and run the previous version of WinAuth. Either click the options button (cog) and choose &quot;Export...&quot;, or use &quot;Change Protection...&quot; and remove your password before taking a copy of your winauth.xml file.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you have made a copy you will always be able to restore that previous version. If you are at all unsure, click Cancel or remove the authenticator from your online account before proceeding." />
